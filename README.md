# Unbeatable_Tictactoe
This is a tic-tac-toe game. The first version uses language Haskell, I rewrote it, added some artificial intelligence algorithm to make it unbeatable, made a GUI for it using pygame, and wrote a test for it to reveal the increase of the rate of success after each time of algorithm improvement.
